I was bored and decided to make my own fetch just for fun. This probably breaks / doesn't work on most people's computers, but it runs fine on mine, which is what matters.

## Dependencies

### Required
- `bash 5`
- `xprop`
- `df`
### Recommended
- `Nerd Fonts`

## Installing

Download the `lubby` script to your `$PATH` and mark it as executable (`chmod +x lubby`)

## Todo

- [ ] Add terminal flags
- [ ] Add proper debugging support
