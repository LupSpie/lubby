<br />

This project's goal is to display system information elegantly that's at least faster than stock neofetch on my machine (pictured above).

## Installing

> **Note**
> You'll need `xprop`, `bash 5+` and a [`Nerd Font`](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to run this script.

Download the `lubby` script to your `$PATH` and mark it as executable (`chmod +x lubby`)

## Customizing

All of the customization is done inside the script itself.

Everything that you may need to change is located at the top of the file, with some more stuff at the bottom `draw()` function.
